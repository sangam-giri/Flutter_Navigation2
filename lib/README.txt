/*We will be learning how to navigate with named routes in this project*/


Two Options
1. Specify maps of routes in main.dart -  We cannpt pass the dynamic data on using this approach (routes map)

2. Specifying a function returning a route, this way you have the benefit of using the main route but also can pass data to the pages

In this project we will be only using the 1st method
